# CTF Room: Committed
- [Link to room](https://tryhackme.com/room/committed)
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Category:** Git, Forensics, Source Control
- **OS:** Linux

## 1. Brief
Committed is a short TryHackMe room about recovering sensitive data from Git history.

The scenario is that a developer accidentally committed sensitive code to a repository and later removed it. Since Git keeps historical commits, the task is to inspect the repository history and recover the flag.

## 2. Lab Setup
The room provides an in-browser VM. The files are located under:

```bash
/home/ubuntu/commited
```

After opening the terminal, I moved into the extracted repository.

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/commited/commited
```

## 3. Reviewing Git History
The first step was to inspect the commit history.

### Git Log
```bash
git log
```

### Output
```bash
commit 28c36211be8187d4be04530e340206b856198a84 (HEAD -> master)

    Connecting to db logic added

commit 441daaaa600aef8021f273c8c66404d5283ed83e
Author: fumenoid <fumenoid@gmail.com>

    Initial Project.
```

The normal log only showed the current branch, so I also checked all branches with a graph view.

### All Branches
```bash
git log --oneline --graph --all
```

### Output
```bash
* 28c3621 (HEAD -> master) Finished
| * 4e16af9 (dbint) Reminder Added.
| * c56c470 Oops
| * 3a8cc16 DB check
| * 6e1ea88 Note added
|/
* 9ecdc56 Database management features added.
* 26bcf1a Create database logic added
* b0eda7d Connecting to db logic added
* 441daaa Initial Project.
```

The `dbint` branch contained an interesting commit named `Oops`, which looked like the likely place where the sensitive value had been removed.

## 4. Recovering The Deleted Secret
I inspected the `Oops` commit directly.

### Git Show
```bash
git show c56c470
```

### Output
```bash
commit c56c470a2a9dfb5cfbd54cd614a9fdb1644412b5
Author: fumenoid <fumenoid@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Feb 13 00:46:39 2022 -0800

The diff shows that the password field previously contained the flag and was later replaced with an empty string.

## 5. Flag

#### Discover the flag in the repository!
### Answer
```bash
flag{a489a9dbf8eb9d37c6e0cc1a92cda17b}
```

## 6. Summary
This room is a straightforward reminder that deleting a secret from the current version of a file does not remove it from Git history.

Using `git log --oneline --graph --all` revealed commits on another branch, and `git show` exposed the exact diff where the sensitive value was removed. The flag was still recoverable from that historical commit.
