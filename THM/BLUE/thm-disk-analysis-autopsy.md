# CTF Room: Disk Analysis & Autopsy
- [Link to room](https://tryhackme.com/room/autopsy2ze0)
- **Difficulty:** Medium

## 1. Brief
Disk Analysis & Autopsy is a TryHackMe room focused on investigating a Windows disk image using Autopsy.

The VM contains an Autopsy case file and the corresponding disk image. After opening the `.aut` case file, the disk image needs to be re-pointed correctly before reviewing the already-ingested artifacts.

## 2. Lab Setup
The room provides an RDP-accessible Windows machine with Autopsy and the case files already present.

### RDP Details
```bash
IP: MACHINE_IP
Username: administrator
Password: ||letmein123!||
```

After connecting over RDP, I opened the Autopsy case and manually reviewed the discovered artifacts.

## 7. Summary
This room was a useful Autopsy practice case because the answers were spread across several common forensic artifact categories.

The system details came from Autopsy's OS information and file metadata, the network details were recovered from Look@LAN configuration files and registry artifacts, and the user activity was reconstructed from bookmarks, images, PowerShell history, desktop files, downloads, prefetch data, and recent documents.
