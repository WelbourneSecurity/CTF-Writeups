# CTF Room: Footprinting Lab - Easy
**Platform:** [HTB](https://academy.hackthebox.com/app/module/112/section/1078)
**Difficulty:** Easy
**Category:** Recon

## 1. Brief
We were commissioned by the company `Inlanefreight Ltd` to test three different servers in their internal network. The company uses many different services, and the IT security department felt that a penetration test was necessary to gain insight into their overall security posture.

The first server is an internal DNS server that needs to be investigated. In particular, our client wants to know what information we can get out of these services and how this information could be used against its infrastructure. Our goal is to gather as much information as possible about the server and find ways to use that information against the company. However, our client has made it clear that it is forbidden to attack the services aggressively using exploits, as these services are in production.

Additionally, our teammates have found the following credentials "*ceil:qwer1234*", and they pointed out that some of the company's employees were talking about SSH keys on a forum.

The administrators have stored a `flag.txt` file on this server to track our progress and measure success. Fully enumerate the target and submit the contents of this file as proof.

## 2. Questions

#### Enumerate the server carefully and find the flag.txt file. Submit the contents of this file as the answer.

We have been given the credentials ceil:qwer1234 and told that we need to look out for SSH keys on a forum. Immediately I think I should be looking for a private key to use with the SSH service. 

I began by enumerating the open ports on the machine.
### NMAP Scan
```bash
nmap -sV -sC --top-ports 1000 footprinting.htb
```

```

I know that I will not be able to use SSH until I have the mentioned key, so I decided to have a look in the FTP server on port 2121, the "Ceil's FTP" makes me think that I can use the given credentials here. 
### FTP Conversation
```bash
ftp footprinting.htb 2121
```
```bash
Connected to 10.129.249.89.

-rw------- 1 ceil ceil 759 Nov 10 2021 .viminfo 
226 Transfer complete
```

Since we are looking for SSH credentials, maybe lets check the .ssh directory (nice one XD). Doing so reveals the SSH key for the user "Ceil". Huzzah!

### FTP further commands 
```bash
ftp> ls

ftp> get id_rsa

```

Since this is an SSH key, it is important that we use chmod to edit the file's privileges. 

### chmod command
```bash
chmod 600 id_rsa
```

### SSH Conversation
```bash
ssh -i id_rsa ceil@footprinting.htb
```
```bash
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

Great Success! 
## 3. Summary
This exercise showed us usage of FTP via non-standard ports, passwordless login via SSH with a keyfile and hidden directories, we will build on these skills in the medium room.
